# The Road to Web3 Project

## Goal

### 2.0 users can access a WebApp to create a Wallet and mint NFTs without any 3.0 knowledge, they can upload an image and decide if they want to mint it.

We will handle the process of creating the Wallet and deliver to the user the seed phrase.
They can see their NFTs in the dashboard and mint new ones.
At the end, they have a wallet with NFTs, and they can decide if they want to keep their profiles at the platform or burn it, but keeping the wallet and their information in the blockchain.

## Getting Started NFT Third You APP

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
